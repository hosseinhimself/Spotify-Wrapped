# Spotify-Wrapped
This project utilizes data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from a user's Spotify listening history, in order to provide personalized recommendations for music artists, genres, and songs. By analyzing the user's music preferences, the project identifies their top artists and genres, as well as their most frequently played songs.

One of the key advantages of this project is that it offers an alternative to Spotify's "Wrapped" feature, which is a year-end summary of a user's listening habits, but is limited to premium account holders. In contrast, this project is accessible to all Spotify users, regardless of their subscription status.

# Example
To get an idea of how the project works, here is an example of a Spotify Wrapped image generated using the project:
